2. a) My site is called the Wine Wanderer App
   b) This app allows users to search for wines by type or rating, view a list of those wines, and download that information directly to their device
   c) The main feature of this app is the ability to download wine information directly to your device. This information consists of the name of the wine, where it is from, the type of wine, and the winery that makes it. I used two different parameters as features, searching by type and searching by rating. This allows users to search by a generalized type, and also the ability to search for wines based on ratings so that they can find what is best for them.
   d) From the landing page, a user will click on the "Start Searching" link, which takes them to the Search page. Here is where they put in their preferred parameters of type of wine and rating, but they don't have to put in both. Once they click the "Search" button, the app will display a list of wines that fit that parameter starting with the highest rated first. From there, the user can download wine information directly to their device.
   e) API Link: https://sampleapis.com/api-list/wines 
   f) The landing page, search page, and results page were designed with HTML and CSS, and the back end is done with Python.
